# Kirkland's Signature-gram

![KS Logo](https://github.com/ngalvin93/kirkland-signature-gram/blob/master/kslogo.png?raw=true)

This is our final project for "Phase 2" of the Flex course for DigitalCrafts Houston. It is focused on backend technologies using Node.js.


# Project Description

Our task is to build a copy of an existing web application using the backend technologies we have learned in Phase 2: express.js, PostgreSQL, knex.js, etc. We will not be designing something "new" for this project. We are choosing something that already exists and rebuilding it from scratch with our team.

# Developer Tools

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build migration
npx knex migrate:latest

# Run seed data
npx knex seed:run

# Start app
npm start

# Test for Standard style
npm test

# Run Standard linting
npx standard --fix
```
