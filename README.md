# Kirkland's Signature-gram

This is our final project for "Phase 2" of the Flex course for DigitalCrafts Houston. It is focused on backend technologies using Node.js.


# Project Description

Our task is to build a copy of an existing web application using the backend technologies we have learned in Phase 2: express.js, PostgreSQL, knex.js, etc. We will not be designing something "new" for this project. We are choosing something that already exists and rebuilding it from scratch with our team.
